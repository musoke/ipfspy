IPFSPY
======

This script will log all the files that are requested by other peers through your IPFS node.

If it sees blocks containing things that are recognizable, it will show the multihash, and the type of the block.

Note: That's a quick'n'dirty hack. Because we look at blocks, files are very likely to be truncated.
